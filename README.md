# Assignment 1: HTML and CSS

## Overview
In this assignment, you will create a simple web application with two pages: a Login Page and an Index Page for a story board website. The user should first land on the Login Page and, after entering their name and password, be taken to the Index Page upon clicking the Submit button. No authentication is required—simply navigating to the next page upon clicking the button is sufficient.

### Designing the Login Page

1. **Create the `login.html` File:**
   - Set up the basic HTML structure using the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
   - Link your CSS file in the `<head>` section using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">`.

2. **Build the Form:**
   - Inside the `<body>` section, create a form with the following fields:
     - An input field for the username.
     - An input field for the password.
     - A submit button.
   - Use `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` tags to create the form elements.
   - Make sure to include a `name` attribute for each input field for easier styling and reference.

3. **Style the Form:**
   - Use CSS to style the form. Create a `css/styles.css` file and link it to your HTML.
   - Ensure the form is centered on the page. Use flexbox or grid layout to achieve this.
   - Style the input fields and submit button to make them visually appealing.

### Designing the Index Page

1. **Create the `index.html` File:**
   - Set up the basic HTML structure.

2. **Build the Page Layout:**
   - Design the layout based on the reference design provided.
   - Include a header, main content area, and footer if required by the design.
   - Use appropriate HTML tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

3. **Style the Index Page:**
   - Use CSS to style the layout.

### Testing

1. **Test Your Pages:**
   - Open `login.html` in a web browser and ensure the form appears correctly.
   - Enter a username and password and click the submit button to check if it navigates to `index.html`. You don’t need to check for a valid email or password—just clicking on the button should take you to the index page. (Hint: try figuring out how you can do it using the anchor tag `<a>`.)
   - Make sure the index page displays as intended and is styled according to the reference design.

## Resources
- Use online resources such as MDN Web Docs and W3Schools for HTML and CSS reference.
